```

## Installation

`npm install -g cfox`

## Initialization

cfox will ask the user to set the password on its first run:

```text
  ______  _______   ______   ___   ___
 /      ||   ____| /  __  \  \  \ /  /
|  ,----'|  |__   |  |  |  |  \  V  /
|  |     |   __|  |  |  |  |   >   <
|  `----.|  |     |  `--'  |  /  .  \
 \______||__|      \______/  /__/ \__\
                             CFox 0.0.4

cfox=#
This is your first time to run cfox, please do some configurations first.
Please set login password: ***
Please confirm the password: ***
cfox=#
Please input password: ***
Login successfully!
```

After that, since there are no wallets added the prompt will use `?` for current wallet:

```text
cfox[?||mainnet]=#
```

The prompt format: `cfox[current_wallet || current_network]`, both will be used by the provider or signer running the blockchain related command. You can use `\c` to change them.

Now, it's time to create a wallet for playing. The simplest way is to run `\a -a`, which will create an random wallet and set it the current wallet because there is no one.

```text
cfox[?||mainnet]=# \a -a
âœ” try to create a new account.
cfox[0xBED16Cd70529D459f4A1A44D6Fe0c6B41364a00C||mainnet]=#
```

The last step of initialization is to set the keys used by cfox. You can find all the external apis supported by running `keys -l`. Currently, the result:

```text
cfox[0xBED16Cd70529D459f4A1A44D6Fe0c6B41364a00C||mainnet]=#keys -l

| name        | value |
-----------------------
| infura      |       |
| morails     |       |
| nft.storage |       |
```

## Commands

Each command has a detailed description and you can always know it by running `help <command>` or `<command> --help`. For example:

```text
cfox[0xBED16Cd70529D459f4A1A44D6Fe0c6B41364a00C||mainnet]=# help qr

  Usage: qr [options] [account]

  Generate a QR Code for an account, current account will be used when account is missing.

  Options:

    --help  output usage information
```

The commands using the external apis:

- `nft`, it will use morails as a fallback for those contracts not implementing `IERC721Enumerable`.
- `upload`, it depends on nft.storage api to fulfill uploading datas to IPFS.

## Development

1. `git clone` this repository.
1. `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
1. `npm start` to start the shell.
1. `npm test` to test all the testcases.
